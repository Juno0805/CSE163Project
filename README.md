# CSE163Project
In order to run the CSE163project.py, you have to import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, pandas as pd,
seaborn as sns, and numpy as np. Also, you have to import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree,
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, and accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics

In order to run the CSE 163 ProjectMain.py, you have to import merge_files, seperate_data, plotting_graphs,
predict_types_of_chest_pain, cp_for_age_groups, separate_graphs, and prediciton_accuracy from CSE163project.py.

Since downloading the datasets that we used requires an account, we will provide them and you also need to import them.
After doing these, you can run our programs.
